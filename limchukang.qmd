# Lim Chu Kang

In the Overview Analysis in Singapore, we found that Lim Chu Kang is topped as the first choice of solar farm in Singapore. To further analyse which site in Lum Chu Kang is suitable for solar farm, we will look into these criteria:

1.  Aspect
2.  Slope
3.  Hillshade
4.  Building Proximity within the area
5.  Roads Proximity within the area
6.  Current Land use planning in the area

For the factors of aspect, slope and hillshade, as these factors are considered as landform factors. We will conduct a final suitability test base on the 3 factors.

Now, let's take a look of each of the factor first:

## Aspect

Aspect refers to the compass direction a slope faces. In solar energy planning, **south-facing slopes** are typically the most optimal in the northern hemisphere. For Singapore (near the equator), **flat or slightly south-facing areas** receive the most consistent sunlight throughout the year.

![](images/aspect_limchukang.png)

From the above map, we can see that the aspect suitability. Much of Lim Chu Kang appears to be in lighter red to white zones, which means moderate to high suitability. The northern and central areas show a mix of white and pale red, suggesting optimal solar exposure. A few dark red patches (unsuitable aspect) are scattered, especially along edges—these may face away from the sun or be steeply sloped.

## Slope

![](images/slope_lck.png)

From the above map, we can see that the central and majority of the interior of Lim Chu Kang, which are classified as class 5 (white), are the most suitable for solar panel deployment. These areas offer expansive, contiguous flat land ideal for efficient and cost-effective installation.

## Hillshade

Hillshade is a visual representation of terrain based on light and shadow, simulating sunlight at a specific angle. In suitability analysis, it reflects **how much sun an area actually receives**, considering elevation and shading from terrain.

![](images/hillshade_lck.png)

From the above map, we can see that most of Lim Chu Kang shows light orange to white, indicating good exposure to sunlight. Some small dark red zones may be in shadow (e.g. valleys or behind elevation changes). Overall, terrain shading is not a major concern, which is good news for solar feasibility.

# Final Suitability of land form features: Aspect, Slope, Hillshade

![](images/final_suitability_lck.png)

From the above image, we can tell that the Lim Chu Kang are generally in high suitability score. However, this is insufficient to decide which specific site is good for installing solar farm.

Therefore, we decide to scope down the area for selection by selecting areas of that are within the top 20% suitability score.

Here is the results:

Base on the final suitability score, we can come up with a few selection on site that we can dive into: (ranking is not relevant)

## Building Proximity within the area

Lim Chu Kang is an area that generally has limited commercial buildings and military facilities. We want to explore how these spaces can help us identify potential areas for solar farms based on the space constraints in the different areas of Lim Chu Kang identified.

![](images/building.png)

Due to Singapore's space constraint, if Lim Chu Kang were to be re-purposed for solar farm, about 20 to 25 acres land area will be required to install the solar farm on land itself, assuming that 1 megawatt of solar energy usually require 4 to 5 acres of land.

## Roads Proximity within the area

Road proximity serve as an informatics for development and installation of solar farms during the construction phase. The darker areas in red represent the most suitable areas that are closer to the roads whereas the lighter reds represent areas further away from the roads. This is done by using the acccessibility factor of:\
\<=100m = 5, 100-200m = 4, 200-300m = 3, 300-500m = 2, \>500m = 1 from roads. This will help us rank the suitability for solar farm installation using road proximity as a factor for economical savings.

![](images/road.png){width="514"}

Based on the 3 different sites considered for the road accessibility based on the darker red colored areas for Lim Chu Kang, we can see that the distance from the roads are mostly \<100 meter, considering the output values to be mutually exclusive with min and max, reflecting the cut-off values. These areas area the most suitable for solar farms due to its accessibility to roads and space constraints (e.g., free from buildings).

![](images/road-parts.png){width="512"}

## Current Land Use planning in the area

![](images/landuse_lck.png)

We also mapped out the current Landuse in Lim Chu Kang to identify the areas which can be used for a potential Solar Farm, and which areas have to be avoided (e.g Reserve Sites, Military). From the Figure above, we can see that the green (open spaces) and bright green(Parks) cover majority of Lim Chu Kang and can be used for potential solar farms.

## Summary 

| Site | Land Use | Building Proximity | Road Proximity |
|----|----|----|----|
| 1: Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve | Park | 230m-369m | \<100m |
| 2: Eastern Lim Chu Kang | Utitlity | 369m-530m | 100-200m |
| 3: Southern and Western Edges | Open Space | 230m-369m | \<100m |
| 4: Southern and Western Edges | Open Space | 230m-369m | \<100m |

# Conclusion

## Optimal Solar Panel Installation Sites in Lim Chu Kang

Based on the detailed site analysis and considering Singapore's unique constraints for renewable energy deployment, we recommend [**Site 2: Eastern Lim Chu Kang**]{.underline} as the best option for large-scale solar panel installation. Here's our comprehensive justification for this selection:

### Land Use Suitability

Site 2 is classified as "Utility" land, which makes it perfect for our solar project because:

-   It avoids the environmental problems we'd face at Site 1 (which is a protected Wetland Reserve).

-   The "Utility" designation means the land is already meant for infrastructure projects. This enhance the feasibility of using the site for installation of solar panels.

### **Spatial Characteristics**

The satellite image shows Site 2 features a large, contiguous open area with what appears to be cleared land with minial vegetation:

-   The expansive area allows for economies of scale in installation and maintenance.

-   The site appears to have less dense vegetation, comparing to site 3 and 4. It helps reducing clearing costs and environmental impact.

### **Building Proximity**

Site 2 has the greatest distance from existing buildings (369m-530m) among all options:

-   It can reduce the shading effects of buildings and hence increase the efficiency of the solar panels.

-   It can reduce potential conflicts with existing building uses.

### **Infrastructure Access**

Although Site 2 is slightly further from the roads compared to other sites, the distance is still practical:

-   Close enough for efficient construction access and maintenance

-   Sufficient proximity to enable grid connection without excessive transmission infrastructure

### Why Other Sites are less suitable

[**Site 1 ((Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve):**]{.underline}

Despite good accessibility (\<100m to roads), its designation as a waterbody in a nature reserve creates significant environmental concerns. Wetland reserves may have strict ecological protections that would conflict with large-scale solar development. In addition, despite floating solar is an option in Singapore, environmentally sensitive waterbodies may not be an ideal location with environmental restrictions.

[**Site 3 & 4 (Southern & Western Edges):**]{.underline}

Site 3 and 4 are smaller than Site 2 so the amount of solar panels will not be as many as Site 2. In addition, they are closed to buildings like Animal Plant & Health Centre, Sungei Gedong Medical Centre, etc. Proximity to buildings might increase shading effect as well. Installing solar panels next to the plot of land might not be the most ideal situation, reducing the efficiency in deployment.

### Implementation Recommendation

As the land use for Site 2 is considered as "Utility", the government might change utilize the land for other usages in the future. To prepare for the possible changes in land use, we recommend this:

-   Deploy a mobile design similar to SL2 at Changi Business Park that allows for future redeployment if land use changes

-   Install Tier-1 solar panels to maximize the efficiency of solar panels and the generation power
