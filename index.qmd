This project is part of SMT201: Geographical information Systems for Urban Planning module, headed by Professor Kam Tin Seong under Singapore Management University, School of Computing and Information Systems. We are given 2 themes to choose from, mainly analysis of farms or land cover change detection. We have decided to go with the first theme: the Application of GIS-based Multi-criteria Analysis for solar farm suitability assessment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the accelerating impact of climate change, including in Singapore, there is an urgent need to expand solar energy adoption. However, Singapore’s limited land resources pose significant challenges in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions. As a densely populated city-state, land use must be carefully balanced between residential, commercial, industrial, and green space demands. The growing demand for public housing, especially Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, further strains land availability, making large-scale solar installations difficult.

Given these constraints, rooftop solar panels have become the primary strategy for solar adoption. Yet, even rooftops face limitations due to shading from surrounding buildings, structural capacity, cloud cover, and the need to reserve space for communal or utility functions.

Our project aims to explore alternatives by analyzing land cover changes in Singapore from 2019 to 2024 using remote sensing data, satellite imagery, and image processing techniques. The analysis highlights Lim Chu Kang as a key area of interest due to its land characteristics and upcoming transformation under the 2030 Master Plan into a sustainable sub-zone. This includes plans for integrating solar panels in greenhouses and exploring innovative land use like underground farming to guard against rising sea levels.

We focus on optimizing solar panel placement on existing infrastructure such as rooftops, reservoirs, and vertical surfaces. Through geospatial analysis and computational modeling, we identify underutilized spaces and evaluate their solar potential while minimizing land-use conflicts.

By selecting the most promising location, our study lays the groundwork for broader implementation across other subzones in Singapore. Our approach contributes to the national goal of achieving 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.

This research offers insights into how Singapore can overcome spatial and environmental constraints through strategic planning, smart energy systems, and innovative design. By combining emerging technologies with geospatial intelligence, we support the nation’s transition to a more sustainable and resilient energy future.
