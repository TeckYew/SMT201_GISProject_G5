    "text": "This project is part of SMT201: Geographical information Systems for Urban Planning module, headed by Professor Kam Tin Seong under Singapore Management University, School of Computing and Information Systems. We are given 2 themes to choose from, mainly analysis of farms or land cover change detection. We have decided to go with the first theme: the Application of GIS-based Multi-criteria Analysis for solar farm suitability assessment.\n\nWIth the growing rate of climate change in many countries, including Singapore, there is a need for the installation of more solar panels. Singapore’s limited land resources have posed significant challenges in the country’s pursuit of sustainable energy solutions. As a highly urbanized city-state, Singapore faces immense pressure to balance land use for residential, commercial, industrial, and green spaces. With an increasing demand for public housing, particularly Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, more land has been allocated to residential development, intensifying the challenge of integrating renewable energy solutions such as solar panels.\nThe installation of solar panels requires substantial space, which is scarce in Singapore due to competing land-use priorities. Given the limited availability of open land, rooftop solar installations have become the primary approach for harnessing solar energy. However, even rooftop installations face constraints due to structural limitations, shading from surrounding high-rise buildings, and the need to allocate space for essential utilities and communal facilities.\nAdditionally, Singapore’s tropical climate presents challenges such as high humidity and cloud cover, which can reduce the efficiency of solar panels. The frequent need for maintenance and cleaning further adds to the complexity of widespread solar adoption. Despite these challenges, the motivation for expanding solar energy usage remains strong, driven by the country’s commitment to sustainability and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.\nIn this project, we aim to analyse the land cover changes of Singapore from 2019 to 2024 through the use of remote sensing data, satellite imagery and image processing techniques. Specifically, we focus on maximizing solar panel placement on existing infrastructure, such as high-rise rooftops, reservoirs, and even vertical surfaces.\nThrough geospatial analysis, satellite imagery, and computational modeling, we assess potential locations for increased solar adoption while minimizing land-use conflicts. By identifying underutilized spaces and implementing smart energy management systems, our project seeks to contribute to Singapore’s long-term goal of achieving 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030. After finding the factors involved in solar farms deployment, we will select the best location for analysis, taking that area as our research ground for uncovering insights into suitability for solar farms. From there, future works will involve using the same techniques for the rest of the sub-zones in Singapore to analyse if they are suitable for solar farm installations as well.\nWith a comprehensive analysis of land availability, solar potential, and emerging technologies, our study provides insights into overcoming the spatial and environmental challenges of solar energy adoption in Singapore. Through strategic planning and innovative solutions, we aim to support the nation’s transition toward a more sustainable and resilient energy future."

    "text": "Singapore is a small city with its unique attractions and natural habitats. Throughout the years, the annual mean temperature has rose by 0.24 degree celsius per decade. As such, over the past few years, Singapore has witnessed significant growth in solar panel deployment due to advancements in renewable energy and decreasing installation costs. Since the second quarter of 2023, the declining costs of solar installations have accelerated the adoption of solar panels across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. In response to this, the government has continued to enhance its solar initiatives, such as the SolarNova program, to increase the nation’s renewable energy capacity and meet Singapore’s long-term sustainability goals. As more rooftops, open spaces, and reservoirs are utilized for solar panel installations, challenges related to land optimization, energy storage, and grid integration are becoming increasingly relevant, especially in Singapore’s land-scarce environment.\nThe Solar energy deployment and efficiency monitoring are critical for sustainable urban planning and energy management. Solar potential assessments involve analyzing factors such as irradiance levels, panel efficiency, and land availability to determine optimal installation sites. Remote sensing and data analytics play a crucial role in tracking solar adoption and optimizing energy distribution. In contrast, energy management strategies focus on integrating solar power into Singapore’s national grid while ensuring stability and efficiency in electricity distribution.\nIn this project, we utilized geospatial analysis and solar irradiance data to assess the growth and efficiency of solar panel installations across key urban areas in Singapore from 2022 to 2024."

    "text": "Motivation\nLim Chu Kang, a sub-zone of Singapore, has set its vision for a master plan 2030 to be completed. This involve the production of 30 per cent of nutritional needs by 2030 using solar panels in greenhouses for harnessing renewable energy and intensifying land use such as growing produce in underground caverns to guard against rising sea levels. As Singapore continues its transition toward renewable energy, solar power has become a cornerstone of its sustainability strategy. While national initiatives have successfully driven widespread adoption, a deeper understanding of how solar panels are distributed, utilized, and optimized remains crucial. Beyond the increasing number of installations, questions arise regarding the effectiveness of current deployment strategies, variations in solar energy yield across different urban settings, and the long-term feasibility of large-scale solar integration in a land-scarce environment. As such, we yearn to analyse the solar farm suitability in the Singapore land cover, and through that, we will narrow down our research into a single sub-zone based on factorial suitability. Then, by considering the factors that determine if Lim Chu Kang is indeed suitable for solar farm installation, this helps us determine the other sub-zones in future works.\nMoreover, as urban landscapes evolve, integrating solar technology into new and existing infrastructure presents both opportunities and challenges. Smart estates, high-rise residential buildings, and industrial zones each offer unique conditions for solar deployment, influencing factors such as energy generation potential, shading effects, and grid compatibility. Innovative solutions, such as floating solar farms and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), have emerged to address spatial constraints, yet their scalability and efficiency in Singapore’s dense urban fabric require further evaluation.\nThis project aims to bridge these knowledge gaps by conducting a comprehensive analysis of solar panel distribution, performance, and integration within Singapore’s urban landscape and Lim Chu Kang. By leveraging geospatial analysis and energy modeling techniques, we seek to assess how different environments impact solar energy generation and explore strategies for enhancing efficiency. Ultimately, our findings will contribute to a more data-driven approach to solar energy planning, supporting Singapore’s broader vision of a resilient and sustainable energy future."

    "text": "As this project is towards GIS-based Multi-criteria Analysis, or what we call Multiple-criteria Decision Analysis (MADM) for solar farm, there are multiple considerations to determine the land area for research. We need to consider the approach to uncover land use factors and as there are many different subzones that can be considered for solar farms installation, uncovering at least one of them will help consider factors that contribute to greater suitability assessment for other areas in Singapore. Lim Chu Kang has caught the attention of us due to its great factorial contributors that helped us determine it to be particularly suitable due to its huge spatial land area and even ground for solar farms, etc..\nFrom our analysis, we can conclude that despite the consistent aspect suitability experienced in Singapore, surface irradiance involving sunlight and slope suitability are 2 of the factors that are viable to suggest suitability of solar farms. The installation of solar farms require lands that have the least slope and greater amount of sunlight, amongst many other factors. This can be attributed to the fact that Lim Chu Kang have been primarily used for commercial purposes and its place for army grounds and cemeteries. Additionally, the upcoming masterplan developments of Lim Chu Kang become a key enablement of Singapore to produce 30 per cent of nutritional needs by 2030 using solar panels in greenhouses for harnessing renewable energy and intensifying land use such as growing produce in underground caverns to guard against rising sea levels, these are potential areas that increase the suitability for Lim Chu Kang as the best land for research.\nThere are many other methods and factors to look out for, in which a research from the Geography compass suggest the use of waterdistance criterion and additional weight criterion for research purposes. Many ways have been conducted to analyse land cover factors for suitability of solar farms, but the change in weather conditions and global warming have outweigh the potential of consistent findings throughout researches. Our findings only contribute to a single subzone of Singapore, and along with many factors involve, we believe that in the future, more works can be done to accomplish what many have set along their path to do."
