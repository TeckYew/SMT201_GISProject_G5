We are given 2 themes to choose from, mainly analysis of farms or land cover change detection. We have decided to go with the first theme: the Application of GIS-based Multi-criteria Analysis for solar farm suitability assessment.\n\nWIth the growing rate of climate change in many countries, including Singapore, there is a need for the installation of more solar panels. Singapore’s limited land resources have posed significant challenges in the country’s pursuit of sustainable energy solutions. As a highly urbanized city-state, Singapore faces immense pressure to balance land use for residential, commercial, industrial, and green spaces. With an increasing demand for public housing, particularly Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, more land has been allocated to residential development, intensifying the challenge of integrating renewable energy solutions such as solar panels.\nThe installation of solar panels requires substantial space, which is scarce in Singapore due to competing land-use priorities. Given the limited availability of open land, rooftop solar installations have become the primary approach for harnessing solar energy. However, even rooftop installations face constraints due to structural limitations, shading from surrounding high-rise buildings, and the need to allocate space for essential utilities and communal facilities.\nAdditionally, Singapore’s tropical climate presents challenges such as high humidity and cloud cover, which can reduce the efficiency of solar panels. The frequent need for maintenance and cleaning further adds to the complexity of widespread solar adoption. Despite these challenges, the motivation for expanding solar energy usage remains strong, driven by the country’s commitment to sustainability and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.\nIn this project, we aim to analyse the land cover changes of Singapore from 2019 to 2024 through the use of remote sensing data, satellite imagery and image processing techniques. Specifically, we focus on maximizing solar panel placement on existing infrastructure, such as high-rise rooftops, reservoirs, and even vertical surfaces.\nThrough geospatial analysis, satellite imagery, and computational modeling, we assess potential locations for increased solar adoption while minimizing land-use conflicts. By identifying underutilized spaces and implementing smart energy management systems, our project seeks to contribute to Singapore’s long-term goal of achieving 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.\nWith a comprehensive analysis of land availability, solar potential, and emerging technologies, our study provides insights into overcoming the spatial and environmental challenges of solar energy adoption in Singapore. Through strategic planning and innovative solutions, we aim to support the nation’s transition toward a more sustainable and resilient energy future."

    "text": "Singapore is a small city with its unique attractions and natural habitats. Throughout the years, the annual mean temperature has rose by 0.24 degree celsius per decade. As such, over the past few years, Singapore has witnessed significant growth in solar panel deployment due to advancements in renewable energy and decreasing installation costs. Since the second quarter of 2023, the declining costs of solar installations have accelerated the adoption of solar panels across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. In response to this, the government has continued to enhance its solar initiatives, such as the SolarNova program, to increase the nation’s renewable energy capacity and meet Singapore’s long-term sustainability goals. As more rooftops, open spaces, and reservoirs are utilized for solar panel installations, challenges related to land optimization, energy storage, and grid integration are becoming increasingly relevant, especially in Singapore’s land-scarce environment.\nSolar energy deployment and efficiency monitoring are critical for sustainable urban planning and energy management. Solar potential assessments involve analyzing factors such as irradiance levels, panel efficiency, and land availability to determine optimal installation sites. Remote sensing and data analytics play a crucial role in tracking solar adoption and optimizing energy distribution. In contrast, energy management strategies focus on integrating solar power into Singapore’s national grid while ensuring stability and efficiency in electricity distribution.\nIn this project, we utilized geospatial analysis and solar irradiance data to assess the growth and efficiency of solar panel installations across key urban areas in Singapore from 2022 to 2024."

    "text": "Motivation\nAs Singapore continues its transition toward renewable energy, solar power has become a cornerstone of its sustainability strategy. While national initiatives have successfully driven widespread adoption, a deeper understanding of how solar panels are distributed, utilized, and optimized remains crucial. Beyond the increasing number of installations, questions arise regarding the effectiveness of current deployment strategies, variations in solar energy yield across different urban settings, and the long-term feasibility of large-scale solar integration in a land-scarce environment.\nMoreover, as urban landscapes evolve, integrating solar technology into new and existing infrastructure presents both opportunities and challenges. Smart estates, high-rise residential buildings, and industrial zones each offer unique conditions for solar deployment, influencing factors such as energy generation potential, shading effects, and grid compatibility. Innovative solutions, such as floating solar farms and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), have emerged to address spatial constraints, yet their scalability and efficiency in Singapore’s dense urban fabric require further evaluation.\nThis project aims to bridge these knowledge gaps by conducting a comprehensive analysis of solar panel distribution, performance, and integration within Singapore’s urban landscape. By leveraging geospatial analysis and energy modeling techniques, we seek to assess how different environments impact solar energy generation and explore strategies for enhancing efficiency. Ultimately, our findings will contribute to a more data-driven approach to solar energy planning, supporting Singapore’s broader vision of a resilient and sustainable energy future."
