We are given 2 themes to choose from, mainly analysis of farms or land cover change detection. We have decided to go with the first theme: the Application of GIS-based Multi-criteria Analysis for solar farm suitability assessment.\n\nSingapore’s limited land resources have posed significant challenges in the country’s pursuit of sustainable energy solutions. As a highly urbanized city-state, Singapore faces immense pressure to balance land use for residential, commercial, industrial, and green spaces. With an increasing demand for public housing, particularly Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, more land has been allocated to residential development, intensifying the challenge of integrating renewable energy solutions such as solar panels.\nThe installation of solar panels requires substantial space, which is scarce in Singapore due to competing land-use priorities. Given the limited availability of open land, rooftop solar installations have become the primary approach for harnessing solar energy. However, even rooftop installations face constraints due to structural limitations, shading from surrounding high-rise buildings, and the need to allocate space for essential utilities and communal facilities.\nAdditionally, Singapore’s tropical climate presents challenges such as high humidity and cloud cover, which can reduce the efficiency of solar panels. The frequent need for maintenance and cleaning further adds to the complexity of widespread solar adoption. Despite these challenges, the motivation for expanding solar energy usage remains strong, driven by the country’s commitment to sustainability and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.\nIn this project, we aim to analyse the land cover changes of Singapore from 2019 to 2024 through the use of remote sensing data, satellite imagery and image processing techniques. Specifically, we focus on maximizing solar panel placement on existing infrastructure, such as high-rise rooftops, reservoirs, and even vertical surfaces.\nThrough geospatial analysis, satellite imagery, and computational modeling, we assess potential locations for increased solar adoption while minimizing land-use conflicts. By identifying underutilized spaces and implementing smart energy management systems, our project seeks to contribute to Singapore’s long-term goal of achieving 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.\nWith a comprehensive analysis of land availability, solar potential, and emerging technologies, our study provides insights into overcoming the spatial and environmental challenges of solar energy adoption in Singapore. Through strategic planning and innovative solutions, we aim to support the nation’s transition toward a more sustainable and resilient energy future."
