# Factorial Analysis Results 

To select Lim Chu Kang as the specific study area for solar panel installation, we considered six critical factors. Each factor plays a unique role in determining the suitability of the area for solar energy deployment. Below is an explanation of each factor and why it was chosen:

1.  Aspect:
    -   Aspect refers to the direction that a slope faces, measured in degrees (0–360°). South-facing slopes (157.5°–202.5°) are optimal for solar panels in Singapore because they receive the most direct sunlight throughout the day due to Singapore's equatorial position.
2.  Slope:
    -   Slope measures the steepness of terrain, expressed in degrees. Flat or gently sloping areas (\<10°) are ideal for solar panels as they allow proper installation angles without structural challenges.
3.  Hillshade:
    -   Hillshade simulates terrain illumination based on sun position (azimuth and altitude). It identifies areas exposed to direct sunlight versus shaded regions.
4.  Surface Ir-radiance:
    -   Surface irradiance measures the amount of solar radiation received per unit area, typically in kWh/m²/year. Higher irradiance levels directly correlate with higher energy generation potential.
5.  Property Prices
    -   Property prices influence the economic feasibility of solar projects. Areas with lower land costs reduce overall project expenses, making large-scale installations more viable.
6.  Power Electricity Grid Flow:
    -   Proximity to existing electrical grid infrastructure is crucial for connecting solar farms and minimizing transmission costs.
