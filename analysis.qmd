# Factorial Analysis Results

To select Lim Chu Kang as the specific study area for solar panel installation, we considered six critical factors. Each factor plays a unique role in determining the suitability of the area for solar energy deployment. Below is an explanation of each factor and why it was chosen:

| **Factors** | Explanation |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Aspect** | Aspect refers to the direction that a slope faces, measured in degrees (0–360°). South-facing slopes (157.5°–202.5°) are optimal for solar panels in Singapore because they receive the most direct sunlight throughout the day due to Singapore's equatorial position. |
| **Slope** | Slope measures the steepness of terrain, expressed in degrees. Flat or gently sloping areas (\<10°) are ideal for solar panels as they allow proper installation angles without structural challenges. |
| **Hillshade** | Hillshade simulates terrain illumination based on sun position (azimuth and altitude). It identifies areas exposed to direct sunlight versus shaded regions. |
| **Surface Ir-radiance** | Surface irradiance measures the amount of solar radiation received per unit area, typically in kWh/m²/year. Higher irradiance levels directly correlate with higher energy generation potential. |
| **Property Prices** | Property prices influence the economic feasibility of solar projects. Areas with lower land costs reduce overall project expenses, making large-scale installations more viable |
| **Power Electricity Grid Flow** | Proximity to existing electrical grid infrastructure is crucial for connecting solar farms and minimizing transmission costs. |

## Aspect:

Aspect is derived from the data of DEM of Singapore. The below is the results of aspect of the entire Singapore.

From the above map, it is hard to tell than which specific area has a good aspect to install solar panels.

Therefore, to better understand the aspect in singapore, we decide to conduct suitability ranking of the aspect data. It may helps us understand which area has a more concentration of good aspect. The following is the ranking we follow:

| **Rank** | **Aspect Range (°)** | **Direction** | **Suitability Rationale** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 5 | 157.5 \< value ≤ 202.5 | True South ±22.5° | Optimal for equatorial solar exposure |
| 4 | 112.5 \< value ≤ 157.5 | Southeast | 95–98% efficiency due to morning sun |
|  | 202.5 \< value ≤ 247.5 | Southwest |  |
| 3 | 67.5 \< value ≤ 112.5 | East | Moderate efficiency (85–90%) |
|  | 247.5 \< value ≤ 292.5 | West |  |
| 2 | 22.5 \< value ≤ 67.5 | Northeast | Lower efficiency (75–80%) |
|  | 292.5 \< value ≤ 337.5 | Northwest |  |
| 1 | 337.5 \< value ≤ 360 | North (Part 1) | Least suitable (60–70%) due to indirect sun |
|  | 0 \< value ≤ 22.5 | North (Part 2) |  |

Here is the results of the aspect suitability in Singapore.

## Slope

Slope is also derived from the data of DEM of Singapore. The below is the results of slope of the entire Singapore.

With this, we decide to conduct suitability ranking of the slope data. The following is the ranking we follow:

| **Rank** | **Slope Range (°)** | **Suitability** | **Key Considerations** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 5 | 0 ≤ slope \< 5 | Most Suitable | Ideal for solar panels; allows optimal tilt (10–15°) without structural adjustments. |
| 4 | 5 ≤ slope \< 10 | Highly Suitable | Slight adjustments needed to achieve optimal tilt; still efficient for installations. |
| 3 | 10 ≤ slope \< 20 | Moderately Suitable | Requires mounting adjustments to avoid exceeding tilt limits; some efficiency loss. |
| 2 | 20 ≤ slope \< 30 | Less Suitable | Steeper slopes require significant structural modifications and risk shading issues. |
| 1 | 30 ≤ slope ≤ 49.152 | Unsuitable | Very steep slopes hinder installation, reduce energy output, and increase maintenance costs. |

With the above results, we

## Hillshade

## Surface Ir-radiance

Hillshare is also derived from the data of DEM of Singapore. The below is the results of hillshade of the entire Singapore.

With this, we decide to conduct suitability ranking of the slope data. The following is the ranking we follow:

| **Rank** | **Hillshade Range** | **Suitability** | **Rationale** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 5 | 200 ≤ hillshade ≤ 255 | Most Suitable | Maximum illumination; ideal for solar panels. |
| 4 | 150 ≤ hillshade \< 200 | Highly Suitable | Good sunlight exposure; minor shading. |
| 3 | 100 ≤ hillshade \< 150 | Moderately Suitable | Partial shading; reduced energy efficiency. |
| 2 | 50 ≤ hillshade \< 100 | Less Suitable | Significant shading; limited solar potential. |
| 1 | 0 ≤ hillshade \< 50 | Unsuitable | Heavy shading; not viable for solar panels. |

## Final Suitability:

Based on Singapore’s equatorial conditions and solar energy guidelines ([BCA](https://www1.bca.gov.sg/), [SERIS](https://www.seris.nus.edu.sg/)), use the following weights:

| **Factor** | **Weight** | **Rationale** |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Slope** | 50% | Most critical – steep slopes (\>15°) are structurally challenging. |
| **Aspect** | 30% | South-facing aspects optimize energy capture in equatorial regions. |
| **Hillshade** | 20% | Ensures minimal shading for consistent energy production. |

### Reclassify final suitability

| **Final Score Range** | **Suitability Class** | **Description** |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 4.5 – 5.0 | 5 (Most Suitable) | Optimal slope, south-facing, minimal shading. |
| 3.5 – 4.5 | 4 | Highly suitable with minor trade-offs. |
| 2.5 – 3.5 | 3 | Moderate suitability; requires adjustments. |
| 1.5 – 2.5 | 2 | Less suitable; significant limitations. |
| 0.0 – 1.5 | 1 (Unsuitable) | Steep slopes, north-facing, or heavy shading. |

Next, we try to map the results with the Singapore subzones and planning areas to see which area with the highest suitability.
