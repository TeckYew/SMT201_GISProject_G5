The chart above shows the overall process that our team employed in our project. In this page, we will go through each of these phases into further detail.

# Data Collection

Data was collected from various sources to be used in the different analyses. Namely, they are:

-   Data.gov.sg:

    -   [Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) (KML)](https://data.gov.sg/datasets?query=2019+subzone+masterplan&resultId=d_0900fdcfdb4666fe2a630f37a532fc06&page=1): Subzone Boundary Layer of Singapore for Master Plan 2019

    -   [Amendment to Master Plan 2019 Land Use layer](https://data.gov.sg/datasets?query=landuse+2019&page=1&resultId=d_f8adc7bd980dd15861c83ff370a72eaa): Landuse Layer for Master Plan 2019

-   [NASA POWER Monthly and Annual API](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/api/pages/?urls.primaryName=Monthly+%26+Annual): This API was used to retrieve surface irradiance data for Singapore.

### Irradiance Data

Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) is a project that seeks to provide data and services related to renewable energy like solar energy. The open API services provided by POWER allows for retrieval of irradiance data for our specified region of the world. This API was used to retrieve the monthly Irradiance values for Singapore from the years 2023-2025.

The parameters for the API Call are as summarised below:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| `parameters` | The climate or solar parameter to retrieve (only one allowed per request) |
| `community` | Defines the user community and data context |
| `latitude-min` | Minimum latitude of the bounding box |
| `latitude-max` | Maximum latitude of the bounding box |
| `longitude-min` | Minimum longitude of the bounding box |
| `longitude-max` | Maximum longitude of the bounding box |
| `start` | Start year of the data request |
| `end` | End year of the data request |
| `format` | Output file format |

The API Call that was used to retrieve the data was therefore:

`https://power.larc.nasa.gov/api/temporal/monthly/point?start=2023&end=2025&latitude=1.3521&longitude=103.8198&parameters=ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN&community=RE&format=CSV`

The API call returns monthly Irradiance values, as well as an annual average. For our analysis, the annual average was used.

### Irradiance Area Calculation

In QGIS, we first load in the Masterplan 2019 Subzone Boundaary Layer.

-   After which, a new field, "Area" was calculated using the field calculator, with the expression : `$area`

-   This area was multiplied by the annual irradiance value of 2023, since it was the year with complete readings.

-   The result was then symbolised on a map with graduated colouring.
