# Data Collection/ Preparation

Data was collected from various sources to be used in the different analyses. Namely, they are:

-   Data.gov.sg:

    -   [Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) (KML)](https://data.gov.sg/datasets?query=2019+subzone+masterplan&resultId=d_0900fdcfdb4666fe2a630f37a532fc06&page=1): Subzone Boundary Layer of Singapore for Master Plan 2019

        -   [Amendment to Master Plan 2019 Land Use layer](https://data.gov.sg/datasets?query=landuse+2019&page=1&resultId=d_f8adc7bd980dd15861c83ff370a72eaa): Landuse Layer for Master Plan 2019

-   [NASA POWER Monthly and Annual API](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/api/pages/?urls.primaryName=Monthly+%26+Annual): This API was used to retrieve surface irradiance data for Singapore.

# MADM Feasibility Topography Analysis

## Power Grid Electricity Flow

The Power Grid Electricity Flow map illustrates electricity transmission from power grids across Singapore, with grid locations highlighted in red. Notably, the central region exhibits denser and more interconnected electrical flow, indicating high infrastructure activity. However, this area is also heavily populated with properties and transport networks—represented by the blue and red points—leaving limited space for solar farm installations. In contrast, areas toward the western region, including Lim Chu Kang, show less development and extended (but lower) grid density, suggesting greater potential for solar farm deployment due to the availability of open land and fewer competing land-use demands.

## Surface Irradiance

### Irradiance Data

Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) is a project that seeks to provide data and services related to renewable energy like solar energy. The open API services provided by POWER allows for retrieval of irradiance data for our specified region of the world. This API was used to retrieve the monthly Irradiance values for Singapore from the years 2023-2025.

The parameters for the API Call are as summarised below:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| `parameters` | The climate or solar parameter to retrieve (only one allowed per request) |
| `community` | Defines the user community and data context |
| `latitude-min` | Minimum latitude of the bounding box |
| `latitude-max` | Maximum latitude of the bounding box |
| `longitude-min` | Minimum longitude of the bounding box |
| `longitude-max` | Maximum longitude of the bounding box |
| `start` | Start year of the data request |
| `end` | End year of the data request |
| `format` | Output file format |

The API Call that was used to retrieve the data was therefore:

`https://power.larc.nasa.gov/api/temporal/monthly/point?start=2023&end=2025&latitude=1.3521&longitude=103.8198&parameters=ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN&community=RE&format=CSV`

The API call returns monthly Irradiance values, as well as an annual average. For our analysis, the annual average was used.

### Irradiance Area Calculation

In QGIS, we first load in the Masterplan 2019 Subzone Boundaary Layer.

-   After which, a new field, "Area" was calculated using the field calculator, with the expression : `$area`

-   This area was multiplied by the annual irradiance value of 2023, since it was the year with complete readings.

-   The result was then symbolised on a map with graduated colouring.

## Property Prices

Property prices are a key economic factor influencing the feasibility of solar farm installations. Areas with higher property values—indicated by darker shades of blue—pose greater challenges, as the cost of land acquisition and ongoing maintenance can outweigh the potential benefits. In contrast, sub-zones represented by lighter shades of blue offer more viable opportunities for solar deployment due to their relatively lower land costs, making them more economically attractive for long-term investment.

# Final Site Selection

With all the factors considered, we decided that the most suitable location for a potential solar farm would be in **Lim Chu Kang.**

We then performed further analysis of the isolated Lim Chu Kang subzone to seek out suitable locations *within* Lim Chu Kang. Factors that were considered were land suitability, proximity to roads, proximity to buildings, and landuse types.

For land suitability, the same topography method was employed, but on the area of Lim Chu Kang. Proximity to roads was considered as it would be a crucial factor in construction of solar fams, in terms of transportation of construction materials. We also analysed proximity between buildings so to identify areas with large enough open spaces that could house a solar farm.

Lastly, for landuse types, we identified that Open Spaces and Agricultural Spaces were the best types of land to host a solar farm on. Open Spaces are available land spaces that are not being used to anything else, and would therefore have the lowest barrier to building a solar farm. Agricultural Lands often contain huge areas of land that are directly exposed to the sun, making them highly suitable spaces as well. For these reasons, landuse analysis was also employed to narrow down the area.

Ultimately, the northern area of Lim Chu Kang, **Sungei Buloh**, was chosen as the most optimal location for a potential solar farm in Singapore.
